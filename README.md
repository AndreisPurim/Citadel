**Citadel** is a personal management system to help you get organized in life.

Basically, I
[(@AndreisPurim)](https://github.com/AndreisPurim) never quite found the tools that I wanted to get myself organized. They either lacked the tools I desired, or became too corporate and bloated. 

So, I started to refine my own management system over the years. It began as an Excel file, evolved into a collection of small Linux .sh functions, and is now implemented as a simple web application. The project reflects a long process of experimentation with tools that better accommodate neurodivergent ways of thinking.

So, it's a very modest tool, but I plan on using and refining it over time (as I have done when it was just a lowly excel file).

It is (and always will be) free and open source, without any subscription or monetization.

The name *citadel* is inspired by the city of Lille, in northern France, where I lived for a period of time (and althought those were chaotic years, the city does have a special place in my heart). Lille's citadel, designed by the military engineer Vauban, was famously described by him as the *"princess of citadels."*

(I also love starforts and the early modern period. My favorite forts are: Lille, Bourtange, Daugavgriva, and Daugavpils. <sub><sup>And while I like the Forte do Pau Amarelo, it is not a starfort and therefore cannot enter the list.</sup></sub>)

# Features

At present, citadel is:
- A **frontend-only** web application
- Fully local and offline-capable

All data is stored locally in the browser and can be exported/imported as JSON. No data is transmitted to external services.

This is because I am not rich and I will not be paying any server.

However, in the future I hope to add a functionality where you can connect this frontend with any custom backend you have. But don't get your hopes up too much.

The project should be considered experimental. Some elements are provisional, and parts of the implementation are exploratory. Refinement and generalization will come later.

It is also extremely vibe-coded. I am sorry for that. I hate when people create slop and I know it is unprofessional. However, it is a free program done in my free time and I will gain no advantage from it.
